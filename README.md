# chess-game

A simple website to play chess against an AI based on the MiniMax algorithm. It uses the [chessboard.js](https://chessboardjs.com/) library for the board's UI, the [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for move generation and validation, and [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) to run Python code directly in the browser.
